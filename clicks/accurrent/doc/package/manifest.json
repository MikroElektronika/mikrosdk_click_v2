    "short_description": "AC Current click is a device that is able to measure the alternating current (AC) running through the conductor, using the so-called non-invasive current sensor. The non-invasive sensor works by utilizing the electromagnetic induction phenomenon, similar to a transformer. The primary coil does not exist though, the electromagnetic field is generated by the AC Current running through the cable which is measured. The core of the sensing probe is split, allowing it to clamp on the current conducting cable. Since the sensor does not influence the measurement circuitry in any way while being galvanically isolated at the same time, it is an ideal solution to measure current running through mains, or similar high voltage installations.",
