    "name": "Angle Click",
    "description": "Angle click is a precise Hall-effect angle sensing click board that can be used to measure the rotational angle of the magnetic field in the X-Y plane above it (parallel to the surface of the click), through the whole range of 360°. The click yields very precise results for both off-axis and axis operation, which make it a perfect choice for precise measuring of the rotational angle in a wide range of different high-speed applications, for example in the automotive industry: electronic power steering, transmission, torsion bar, or the motor shaft rotation.",
