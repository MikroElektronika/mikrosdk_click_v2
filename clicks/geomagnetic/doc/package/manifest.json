    "short_description": "GeoMagnetic click is a digital magnetometric click board which can measure the geomagnetic field in three perpendicular axes. The onboard sensor uses FlipCore - a proprietary technology from Bosch, which results with a carefully tuned performance, tailored for demanding 3-axis mobile applications, such as a tilt-compensated electronic compass, gaming controllers, augmented reality applications and similar applications which require reliable and precise 3-axis magnetometric measurement.",
