    "description": "Magnetic Rotary 2 Click is a compact add-on board used for accurate magnet-position sensing. This board features the AEAT-9922, an angular magnetic rotary sensor providing accurate angular measurement over a full 360 degrees of rotation from Broadcom Limited. The AEAT-9922 uses integrated Hall sensor elements with complex analog and digital signal processing within a single device. The absolute angle measurement provides an instant indication of the magnet's angular position with a selectable and one-time programmable resolution from 10 to 18 bits.",
