    "description": "MCP251863 Click is a compact add-on board representing a complete CAN solution used as a control node in a CAN network. This board features the MCP251863, IC representing a compact solution with a controller and a transceiver in one package, the MCP2518FD and ATA6563 from Microchip. The ATA6563, a low-level physical layer IC (PHY), provides a physical connection with the CAN bus itself, while the CAN controller MCP2518FD represents an interface between the MCU and the PHY. It features three operating modes with dedicated fail-safe features, remote wake-up via CAN, and ideally passive behavior when powered off on the CAN bus. This Click board™ is suitable for developing a wide range of automotive diagnostic applications, even on MCUs that don’t support CAN interface.",
