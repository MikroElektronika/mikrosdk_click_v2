    "short_description": "Multi Stepper Click is a compact add-on board that contains a bipolar stepper motor driver. This board features the TB67S209FTG, CLOCK-in controlled bipolar stepping motor driver from Toshiba Semiconductor. It supports a PWM constant-current control drive, selectable mixed decay mode, and allows from full-step up to 1/32 steps resolution for less motor noise and smoother control. It has a wide operating voltage range of 10V to 47V with an output current capacity of 2.8A in addition to several built-in error detection circuits.",
