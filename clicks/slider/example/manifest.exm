    "description": "Slider click features a mechanical slide action potentiometer - a slider, which gives a nice feeling when actuating, along with 16 SMD LEDs, that can be used for any kind of visual feedback. The onboard high-resolution 22-bit ADC can detect even the smallest move, faithfully capturing the smoothness of the slider movement, while digitizing its position. The 16 onboard SMD LEDs can give a nice visual feedback of the slider position, but those LEDs can also be used for other purposes since they are not hardwired to the slider.",
