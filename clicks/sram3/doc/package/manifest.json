    "short_description": "SRAM 3 Click is a compact add-on board that contains a serial non-volatile SRAM with a high storage capacity. This board features the ANV32AA1WDK66, a 1Mb serial SRAM with a non-volatile SONOS storage element included with each memory cell organized as 128k words of 8 bits each from Anvo-System Dresden. The serial SRAM provides fast access & cycle times, high data accuracy, ease of use, and unlimited read & write accessed by a high-speed SPI compatible bus. This Click board™ is suitable to store drive profiles, configurations, and similar data, or for applications such as medical devices, industrial automation (for example, motor control and robotics), smart metering systems, and many others.",
